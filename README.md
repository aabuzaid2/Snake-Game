# Snake-Game

This project is a basic implementation of a snake game

In the future, I plan to implement some sort of increasing difficulty where the higher the score you get the faster the snake moves.
Also, I want to find a way to optimize my draw function (for instance only erase the head and the last part of the tail and redrawing them instead of redrawing the whole snake) since the clear screen method is not the best and causes a lot of stutter, also it will help me increase the gameplay area.
Finally I want to learn how I could add some better graphics for the game.
